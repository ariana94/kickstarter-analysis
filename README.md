# kickstarter-analysis
### An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
In this project we are looking at trends throughout Kickstarter. We can track everything from name, goal, pledged amount
date created, date ended, category, and much more. By filtering this data we are able to pinpoint specific trends among
successful and unsuccessful campaigns. We are aiming to help our friend Louise to be successful with her future campaign.

In this chart we can see the outcomes of all campaigns across the entire project in relevance to the date they were created.
May, June, and July were great months to start a campaign!

In this bar chart, we can see the outcomes of US Kickstarters through the parent categories. 
Theater had the highest total number, highest failed, and highest successful rates.
All Journalism campaigns were canceled.

 In the above box chart, we can see that the mean for goals of musical campaigns is around £4,000 while the median is around £2,000. This
 shows that the data is heavily skewed to the right. Half of the campaign goals are under £2,000 which is just about the same amount as
 the thrid quartile for amounts pledged.

 With this data, I would reccommend that Louise starts her Great Britain based campaign between May and July, as a play and set a goal of less than £4,000
